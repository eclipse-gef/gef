# Contributing to the Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF)

This guide provides all necessary information to enable [contributors and committers](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#2_3_1_Committers) to contribute to the Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) project. [Users](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#2_3_2_Users), who want to use the end-user tools, as well as [adopters](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#2_3_3_Adopters), who want to develop applications against GEF, should rather consult our [README](https://github.com/eclipse/gef#eclipse-graphical-editing-framework-gef).

## Set up a development environment

You can set up a pre-configured IDE for the development of GEF FX using the following link:

[![Create Eclipse Development Environment for GEF Classic](https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/www/setups/svg/GEF_FX.svg)](https://www.eclipse.org/setups/installer/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-git/gef/master/org.eclipse.gef.releng/GEFConfiguration.setup&show=true "Click to open Eclipse-Installer Auto Launch or drag onto your running installer's title area")

This automates all the steps below, many of which are outdated.

### Install JDK 11 / OpenJFX 11

The current [5.4 (2022-06)](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.gef/releases/5.4.0-2022-06) development stream uses a minimal BREE (bundle required execution enviroment) of JavaSE-1.8 for all bundles. However, GEF aims to be compatible to Java 11, so if you want to contribute, you will thus have to install a current Java SE Development Kit 11. In addition, you will need a matching version of JavaFX.

* [OpenJFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

### Prepare an Eclipse IDE

We recommend to download a recent '[Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers (2022-03)](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2022-03/r)' package and to prepare it as outlined below.

1) Install `PDE API Tools Execution Environment Descriptors`

1) Install `e(fx)clipse - IDE - PDE` from <https://download.eclipse.org/efxclipse/updates-released/3.8.0/site/>

1) Install `Xtext Complete SDK` in version 2.26

1) Install `m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse (includes Incubating components)`

See below for details.

#### Install PDE API Tools Execution Environment Descriptions

All production code bundles (i.e. excluding doc and test bundles) are configured to have PDE API tooling enabled. The API checks, which are configured on a project-specific basis, include checks for references that do not exist in the specified execution environment. As API tooling requires execution environment descriptions (see [Installing Execution Environment Descriptions](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Execution_Environments#Installing_Execution_Environment_Descriptions) for details) to perform the respective checks, these need to be made available, because otherwise you will see warnings for missing execution environment descriptions.

#### Install e(fx)clipse JavaFX-PDE-Integration

In order to properly resolve all JavaFX dependencies, the JavaFX-PDE-integration (`org.eclipse.fx.ide.pde.feature`) provided by the [e(fx)clipse](https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/index.html) project is required. As certain parts of JavaFX (e.g. the SWT integration) are not included in the JRE definition, the respective classes will not be available as a JRE System Library to the GEF bundles. The e(fx)clipse JavaFX-PDE-integration will automatically add additional classpath entries to the bundles, so all these dependencies can also be resolved.

Install `e(fx)clipse - IDE - PDE` (`org.eclipse.fx.ide.pde.feature.feature.group`) in a version matching your IDE. For 2022-03, it can be installed in version 3.8.0 from <https://download.eclipse.org/efxclipse/updates-released/3.8.0/site/>.

To ensure that the e(fx)clipse JavaFX-PDE integration can properly locate those JavaFX libraries that are not included in the JRE definition, the Java execution environment for JavaSE-1.8 has to be resolved against a matching Java 11 JDK. To ensure that this is the case:

1. Go to *Windows -> Preferences -> Java/Installed JREs* and ensure the installed Java SE Development Kit 11 is listed (otherwise add it manually).
2. Go to *Windows -> Preferences -> Java/Installed JREs/Execution Environments* and make sure JavaSE-1.8 is mapped to the installed Java SE Development Kit 11 (the checkbox needs to be checked, otherwise e(fx)clipse will not be able to resolve the JavaFX dependencies).
3. Go to *Windows -> Preferences -> JavaFX* and configure *JavaFX 11 + SDK* to point to the `lib` folder of your OpenJFX installation.

#### Install Xtext Complete SDK

Parts of the DOT bundles (*org.eclipse.gef.dot*, *org.eclipse.gef.dot.ui*) contain sources that are generated by Xtext as well as Xtend.
These generated sources are not contained in the Git repository and have to be generated locally within the development workspace. The Xtend files will be automatically compiled to Java files (by means of a builder) as soon as the Xtend IDE is installed. The generation of Xtext artfifacts however needs to be triggering manually (see [Generate Xtext Artifacts](#Generate Xtext Artifacts)), which requires installation of Xtext Complete SDK into your Eclipse IDE, or by executing a local Maven build (see below).

#### Install Maven Integration (m2e)

In case you want to run a headless build locally in your workspace, the [Maven Integration (m2e)](http://eclipse.org/m2e/) is needed, as the headless build is based on Maven/Tycho.

Please install *m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse (includes Incubating components)* in a version matching your IDE. (It is already pre-installed in the *IDE for Eclipse Committers* mentioned above.)

#### Install Eclipse RelEng Tools

To ensure that bundle versions and Maven pom.xml versions are in sync, the Eclipse RelEng Tools are very helpful.

It is recommended that you install the 'Eclipse RelEng Tools' into your IDE. Please make sure that you install it in a version matching to your IDE. For Neon, it can be installed in version 3.9.0 from [http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.6](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.6).

### Check out the code using EGit

Having set up the Eclipse IDE, next is to [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and to check out the sources into the local workspace. Using EGit, this can be performed as follows:

* Copy the URI of your repository fork to your clipboard.
* Open the *Git* perspective (provided by EGit) within Eclipse, and click on *Clone a Git repository*.
* Select *Clone URI* and press *Next >*.
* If you have copied the URL of your fork into the clipboard before, the upcoming *Clone Git Repository* dialog should already provide the necessary entries for *URI*, *Host*, and *Repository path*, so you may simple forward by pressing *Next >*.
* Select the branches you want to clone from remote. The *master* branch is the one used for the current development stream. Development in maintenance releases is performed in respective maintenance branches. After having selected all branches of interest, press *Next >* to continue.
* Choose a local directory to store the cloned repository (the default will be located under your home directory), select the *Initial branch* to check out, and check the box to *Import all existing Eclipse projects after clone finishes*. Press *Finish*.
* Switch back to the *Java* perspective.

### Set Target Platform

Multiple target definition files are provided by the `org.eclipse.gef.target` project. To specify the target platform, simply open the respective target definition (e.g. *2022-03.target*) within the *Target Editor*, let it fully resolve (i.e. wait until the *Resolving Target Definition* background task has finished and the installable units are listed under the respective *Locations*), then choose to *Set as Target Platform*).

In case the target editor does not properly resolve the target definition, an invalid target cache may be the cause. In such cases, opening the target definition file with a text editor and incrementing the sequence number manually, will invalidate the cache when reopening it with the target editor again. After the cache has been invalidated, the sequence number can be restored.

### Define API Baseline

All production code bundles (i.e. excluding doc and test bundles) are configured to have PDE API tooling enabled. It is used to ensure compliance of sources to the specified execution environments, as well as to ensure proper semantic versioning. As PDE API tooling requires the definition of an API baseline you will see errors after having checked out the code ('An API baseline has not been set for the current workspace.').

API-baselines are provided by the `org.eclipse.gef.baseline` project. You may define them by going to *Preferences -> Plug-in Development -> API Baselines*, then choose to select "Add Baseline..." and point to the `plugins` sub-folder of an API baseline located in the baselines project (note that the dialog browses the file system instead of the workspace, so you will have to point into the respective folder in your local Git repository).

### Generate Xtext Artifacts

Parts of the DOT code base (`org.eclipse.gef.dot`, `org.eclipse.gef.dot.ui`) contain sources that are generated by Xtext. These generated sources are not contained in the Git repository and have to be generated locally within the development workspace.

If you have installed Xtext in your IDE, you can manually trigger the Xtext artifact generation by selecting `Dot.xtext` within the `org.eclipse.gef.dot.internal.language` package in `org.eclipse.gef.dot` in the Package Explorer, and by choosing *Run As -> Generate Xtext Artifacts* from the context menu.

Alternatively you may execute a Maven build locally. Make sure to refresh the *org.eclipse.gef.dot* and *org.eclipse.gef.dot.ui* projects in your workspace after having executed the local build (*Refresh* from context menu on respective projects, or *F5*), and make sure to clean your workspace afterwards (*Project -> Clean -> Clean all projects*).

## Create and test a contribution

Having properly set up your development environment you can start working on the necessary changes. Please ensure to execute the *all* test-suite that exists for each bundle that was changed to be safe against regressions. In case your change is not trivial, it is recommended to add respective tests to demonstrate that the fix is adequate. You can either call the *AllTests* suite contained in the test bundles of all GEF components, or run a headless Maven build locally (which will also execute the tests).

## Run a headless build

GEF uses a Maven/Tycho-based build infrastructure. With the [Eclipse Maven Integration](http://eclipse.org/m2e/), a headless build can also be executed in the local workspace. Make sure you have checked out all projects of the respective git repository. Then easily run the build by right-clicking the `pom.xml` file located within the `org.eclipse.gef.releng` project, and selecting 'Run As -> Maven build...'.

In the configuration wizard you have to specify the goals ("clean verify") and the target profile (e.g. "2022-03.target") for the build. Note that without setting the target profile the build will not run successfully. The build needs to be executed with a Java 11 VM, so if you have installed multiple JVMs, you should check the settings in the *JRE* tab.

As a result of the build, an update-site will be created in the `target` sub-folder of the `org.eclipse.gef.repository` project.
